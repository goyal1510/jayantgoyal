# Development Sessions

This directory contains daily session notes tracking the development progress of the File Manager project.

## Structure

- Each day has its own markdown file: `day-0.md`, `day-1.md`, etc.
- Use `TEMPLATE.md` as a starting point for new session notes
- Update the corresponding day's file with what was accomplished

## How to Use

1. At the start of each day, copy `TEMPLATE.md` to `day-X.md` (where X is the day number)
2. Fill in the session details as you work
3. Update the checklist in `PLAN.md` as tasks are completed
4. Commit session notes along with code changes

## File Naming

- `day-0.md` - Planning and setup
- `day-1.md` - Day 1 work
- `day-2.md` - Day 2 work
- ... and so on

## What to Include

- Tasks completed
- Code changes made
- Challenges faced
- Solutions implemented
- Next steps
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Links to PRs or commits
